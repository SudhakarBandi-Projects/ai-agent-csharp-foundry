**Azure** is a cloud computing platform and set of services created by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of cloud services, including:

- **Computing power** (virtual machines, containers)
- **Storage solutions** (databases, file storage, back-up)
- **Networking** (virtual networks, load balancers)
- **AI and machine learning**
- **IoT (Internet of Things) services**
- **DevOps and development tools**

With Azure, businesses and individuals can build, deploy, and manage applications through Microsoft-managed data centers around the world. This means you don’t need to own or maintain physical servers; you can use Azure’s resources on-demand and pay for what you use.

Azure supports many programming languages, frameworks, and operating systems, making it flexible for various types of projects—like hosting web and mobile applications, analyzing big data, building machine learning models, backing up critical data, and much more.

**In short:**  
Azure is Microsoft’s cloud platform that lets you run applications and services globally, scalably, and cost-effectively—without worrying about managing hardware and infrastructure yourself.
